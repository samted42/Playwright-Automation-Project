# Test Plan for AutomationExercise Automation Testing

This document outlines the test plan for automating the [Automation Exercise](https://automationexercise.com) website using **Playwright** and **TypeScript**. The purpose of this plan is to ensure comprehensive test coverage, efficient defect detection, and validation of critical workflows.

---

## 1. Objectives

- Automate the testing of key features on the Automation Exercise website.
- Validate the functionality, responsiveness, and performance of the site.
- Ensure test scenarios cover cross-browser and cross-device compatibility.
- Provide regression testing to detect issues introduced during development updates.

---

## 2. Scope

### **In-Scope**
1. **Functional Testing**:
   - Login and Signup workflows.
   - Product search and filtering.
   - Cart and checkout processes.
   - Navigation and general UI testing.

2. **Cross-Browser Testing**:
   - Chrome (Chromium), Firefox, and WebKit browsers.

3. **Responsive Design Testing**:
   - Desktop (1920x1080)
   - Tablet (768x1024)
   - Mobile (375x667)

4. **Regression Testing**:
   - Re-run automated tests to ensure no existing features break after code changes.

### **Out of Scope**
- Backend/API testing (as this focuses on UI automation).
- Load or performance testing.

---

## 3. Test Strategy

### 3.1 Automation Framework
The testing framework will use **Playwright** in combination with **TypeScript** for building scalable, efficient, and reliable test cases.

### 3.2 Tools and Technologies

| **Signup**          | - Verify user registration with valid and invalid data<br> - Duplicate user creation validation|
| **Search**          | - Search for existing products<br> - Search for non-existing products                         |
| **Cart Operations** | - Add product to cart<br> - Update product quantity<br> - Remove product                      |
| **Checkout**        | - Verify end-to-end checkout with valid details<br> - Invalid payment validation              |
| **Navigation**      | - Validate all navigation menu items                                                         |
| **Responsive Testing** | - Test UI components on different device sizes (desktop, tablet, mobile)                  |

### 4.2 Bug Classification
- **Critical Bugs**: Features blocking user workflows such as login, signup, or checkout failures.
- **High Priority Bugs**: Issues impacting core functionality but with available workarounds.
- **Low Priority Bugs**: Minor UI inconsistencies that do not affect usability.

## 8. Reporting and Metrics

### 8.1 Test Reports
Playwright allows generating detailed HTML reports for test executions. All reports will capture:
- Test case result (pass/fail)
- Screenshots and videos of failed tests
- Error logs, if applicable

Reports can be generated using:
```bash
npx playwright show-report
```

### 8.2 Metrics for Evaluation
- Percentage of tests passing.
- Number of critical defects detected.
- Time taken for each test suite.
- Device/browser compatibility statistics.

---

## 9. Defect Management

Defects will be logged into GitHub Issues, with the following fields:
- Title
- Description of the defect
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Severity

---

## 10. Risks and Dependencies

### Risks
- Frequent updates to the site under test may require test maintenance.
- Browser compatibility issues in new versions may interrupt workflows.

### Dependencies
- Availability of browsers and necessary dependencies for Playwright.
- Internet connectivity for accessing the site during execution.

---

## 11. Approval Criteria

Test execution is considered successful if:
- All critical and high priority tests pass.
- No critical or blocker defects remain unresolved.
- All regression tests produce consistent results.
